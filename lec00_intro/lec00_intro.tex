\begin{BOX}{App development?}
CMPUT391 \alert{is NOT} about application development --- Web and/or mobile database applications are covered in other courses.
\end{BOX}

\vskip1em
\begin{BOX}{Data Science?}
CMPUT391 \alert{is NOT} a crash-course on Data Mining, Analytics, Big Data or Data Science.
\end{BOX}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{CMPUT 291 vs CMPUT 391?}


\begin{block}{CMPUT 291 focused on \alert{\textbf{using} DBMSs}}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic* -]
\item data modelling
\item translating questions into queries
\item application development with a DBMS vs using files
\end{enumerate}

\end{block}

\vskip2em

\begin{block}{CMPUT 391 focuses on \alert{\textbf{how} DBMSs \textbf{work}}}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic* -]
\item start with a single-user DBMS using a single CPU computer
\item look at how data is stored, queries are processed, and updates are scheduled
\item then look at a multi-user distributed DBMS
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What was CMPUT291 about?}
\begin{BOX}{Organizing data into a relational database}
 Application requirements $\rightarrow$ ER diagram + constraints\\
 ER diagram + constraints $\rightarrow$ Initial Schema $\rightarrow$ Normalized schema
\end{BOX}

\vskip2em

\begin{BOX}{Querying the database to satisfy an information need}
 Application/user information \textbf{need} $\rightarrow$ SQL query
\end{BOX}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example}

\begin{columns}[onlytextwidth]
\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
\textbf{Requirements}: create an application to keep track of movies, their directors, their actors (with the role they play), and the cinemas where the movies are showing (with the start time). 
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figures/Movies_ER}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\vskip0.5em

Must handle remakes (i.e., newer movie with the same title of an old one), and record IMDB scores (0 to 10) for the movies\footnote{A better design would be to also record the date when the IMDB score was collected, as they changes over time.}.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\label{schema1}
\vskip1em
\scalebox{0.9}{\usebox{\FullMovieSchema}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

In CMPUT291 you learned about \alert{schema refinement} by \textbf{normalization}, through decomposing relations that did not conform with a normal form.

\begin{itemize}[-, noitemsep, topsep=-5pt]
\item Normalization removes the chance of many update anomalies (which can cause many data inconsistencies). 
\item However, decomposing a ``conceptual'' relation into several smaller ones means we often need to \textbf{join} them back together to answer user queries.
\end{itemize}

\vskip1em 

In some applications, the extra cost of the joins might be unacceptable, in which case the schema is de-normalized for performance reasons.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

In CMPUT391 we will use a de-normalized, but simpler schema, where we represent the relationship \lstinline{Movie}--\lstinline{Director} as an attribute of \lstinline{Movie}, we eliminate the need for joins:

\vskip0.5em

\begin{center}
\hspace*{-1em}\fbox{\usebox{\SimplifiedMovieTableDDL}} % create table Movie
\end{center}

\vskip0.5em

\alert{PROS:} querying for movie directors is faster... \alert{CONS:} can't record movies with multiple directors; and directors disappear from the database if we delete their movies.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\label{schema2}

\underline{Simplified schema} used in the examples

\scalebox{0.9}{\usebox{\SimplifiedMovieSchema}}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]{Querying}

In CMPUT 291 you focused on translating \textbf{user/application needs} like ``who are the actors in movies directed by Debra Granik rated 7 or higher on IMDB?''

\vskip1em

Into \textbf{SQL}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=SQL]
SELECT c.actor
FROM Cast c, Movie m
WHERE c.title=m.title AND c.year = m.year AND
      m.director = 'Debra Granik' AND m.IMDB >= 7;
\end{lstlisting}

\vskip1em

In 391 we care only about \textbf{how} to execute queries fast.

\begin{columns}[onlytextwidth]

\begin{BOX}{Transactions?}

All of that in single computer or distributed/parallel computer settings.

\begin{frame}{How do we look at a database in 391?}

The schema (normalized or not) goes way.

We look at the files that store data (i.e., tables) and files that help us get to the data fast (i.e., indexes).

\vskip2em

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [anchor=north west] at (-0.15,0) {\scalebox{0.85}{\usebox\TitleYearIndexOnMovie}} ;
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What about queries and SQL updates?}

We want to understand what is the \alert{most efficient} way to execute them, keeping in mind:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item data is kept in secondary memory and must be brought into memory before anything can be done to them;

\item the most efficient way of processing a statement depends both on \emph{static factors} (e.g., data organization) and \emph{dynamic factors} (e.g., the system load);

\item the DBMS \textbf{must support} multiple users/applications reading/writing the same database \textbf{concurrently}

\item the DBMS \textbf{must protect} the data from system failures, and \alert{ensure the database remains \textbf{consistent}} after each update
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What \alert{else} is covered in CMPUT 391?}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic* - ]
	\item Advanced relational constraints (aka Business Rules or Triggers)
	\item Advanced SQL (recursion, crisp semantics and evaluation algorithms)
	\item Non-relational data models and queries
		\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman* - ]
		\item RDF and SPARQL (\textbf{on your own} -- homework)
		\item XML and XQuery
		\item JSON and JSONiq (\textbf{on your own} -- homework)
		\item Spatial data and Nearest Neighbor queries (\textbf{on your own} -- coding asisgnments)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Prerequisites}

Prerequisite material which you are \highlight{expected to know} and will be tested on:

\vskip1em

\begin{block}{\alert{CMPUT 291}}
 - the relational model, SQL (DDL and DML) and the algebra\\
 - writing queries and translating between the algebra and SQL
\end{block}

\vskip1em

\begin{block}{\alert{CMPUT 201}}
- C programming; compiling and debugging C programs\\
- working with the command line and large files; git
\end{block}

\vskip1em

\begin{block}{\alert{CMPUT 204}}
- algorithms and data structures (e.g., linked lists, sorting, hashing)\\
- estimating time and space costs (e.g., $O(1)$, $O(n)$, $O(\log n)$).
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Common student complaints -- and the truth behind them}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic* - ]
\item not enough time to do the assignments -- \alert{you have at least 3 weeks for each assignment}

\item \textbf{too much reading} -- \alert{no comment}

\item \textbf{we are supposed to learn things on our own} -- \alert{no comment}

\item no part marks for ``getting the idea right'' -- \alert{no reasonable answer is turned down in 391}

\item assignments are not worth enough -- \alert{they are there for you to practice and learn; plus \textbf{you will be tested on then in the exams}}

\item exams cover material not taught in class -- \alert{\textbf{yes they do}! homework and assignments are covered in the exams.}
\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Plagiarism -- what you should know}

\alert{\textbf{Every single case of plagiarism in CMPUT391 will be reported to the Faculty of Science.}}

\vskip1em

In previous academic terms sanctions were applied by the Faculty in every case reported. 

Most cases resulted in at least one letter grade reduction.

Repeating offenders received reductions of \alert{3 letter grades}.

Students have failed CMPUT391 because of cheating.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How to succeed in CMPUT391?}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]

\item Start early on the homework. They do take a lot of time.

\item \alert{\textbf{Consult a}} database \textbf{systems} \alert{book} regularly. Some slides condense many pages of material that cannot be explained in detail in class.

\item Read the supplemental material referenced from the slides.

\item \alert{Answer the practice questions} on your own. Most exam questions will be very similar to them.

\item Consult your TA regularly; ask them to help you with the practice questions.
\end{enumerate}
