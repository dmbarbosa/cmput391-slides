\title{High Performance Databases and ``NoSQL''}

\begin{columns}[onlytextwidth]
\begin{column}{0.75\textwidth}
The ``NoSQL movement'' started as frontal opposition to relational database systems in general.

\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{block}

Over time, adopters of the movement realized that abandoning all of the relational technologies meant giving up too much.

Today, NoSQL is often used to mean \alert{Not Only} SQL. In other words, their proponents advocate using systems that support (at least a subset of) SQL in addition to other access methods and languages.

\section{Parting Thoughts}

\begin{frame}

High Performance Computing architectures, in particular, shared-nothing clusters of computers organized into a ``cloud'', are becoming the norm in supporting database applications.

Two key advantages of this approach are distributing the data across nodes to reduce the risk of data loss and increase availability of the data.

The compromise is that updates to the data require a lot more effort: multiple nodes need to coordinate via the network, which is much slower.

As a result, most NoSQL systems do not support complex constraints and do not offer full SQL support.
